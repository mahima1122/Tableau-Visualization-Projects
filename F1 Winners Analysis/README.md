# Formula One Winners Analysis from year 2012-2022
  ## About
  Formula One, commonly known as Formula 1 or F1, is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale   de l'Automobile (FIA). In this project, I was explored the F1 Winners dataset obtained from Kaggle and used Tableau to create my vizualizations. 
  ## Dataset
  The F1 Seasons Champions dataset contains around 220 records with various fields, including grand prix, winners, winning teams, and many others by year. The dataset can be found on the following links:

  ## Tableau Dashboard
  Based on the dataset, I created a dashboard that showcases different insights after exploring the data using the tableau software. 
  The dashboard can also be accesed on Tableau Public following the link below:
